            <h2 class="section-title">A Full Time Facilitator?</h2>
            <p>An adequate Scrum Master can handle two or three teams at a time. If you're content to limit your role to organizing meetings, enforcing timeboxes, and responding to the impediments people explicitly report, you can get by with part-time attention to this role. Probably nothing catastrophic will happen.</p>
            <p>But if you envision a team that succeeds at things they didn’t previously realize they could do, consider being a great Scrum Master.</p>
            <p>A great Scrum Master can handle one team at a time. We recommend one dedicated Scrum Master per team of about six when starting out.</p>
            <p>If you haven't discovered all the work there is to do, tune in to your Product Owner, your team, your team's engineering practices, and the organization outside your team. While there's no single prescription for everyone, I've outlined typical things I've seen Scrum Masters overlook. Please mark each box with √, ∆, ?, or N/A, as described on the last page.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Part I -- How Is My Product Owner Doing?</h2>
            <p>Scrum Masters improve Product Owner effectiveness in many ways.</p>
            <div class="checkbox-list">
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Regardless of the number of teams, is there one (and only one) Product Owner for the product?</label>

            <h2 class="section-title">Part II -- How Is My Team Doing?</h2>
            <p>While the Scrum Master are encouraged to lead by the example of collaborating with team members on their work, there is a risk of getting lost in technical tasks. Consider your primary responsibilities to the team:</p>
            <div class="checkbox-list">

                <label><input type="checkbox"> Are there issues and opportunities the team isn't discussing because they're too uncomfortable?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Have you tried a variety of formats and locations for Sprint Retrospectives?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Has the team kept focus on Sprint goals?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Does the Sprint taskboard reflect what the team is actually doing?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Does your team have 3-9 people with a sufficient mix of skills to build a potentially shippable product increment?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Is your team's taskboard up to date?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Are the team self-management artifacts visible to the team, convenient for the team to use?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Are these artifacts adequately protected from meddlers?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Do team members volunteer for tasks?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Has the need for technical debt repayment been made explicit in the definition of done?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Are team members leaving their job titles at the door of the team room, collectively responsible for all aspects of agreed work?</label>

                <label><input type="checkbox"> Is the team writing both system tests and unit tests in the same language as the system they're developing?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Has your team discovered the useful gray area between system tests and unit tests?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Does a continuous integration server automatically sound an alarm when someone causes a regression failure?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Do all tests roll up into the continuous integration server result?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Have team members discovered the joy of continuous design and constant refactoring?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Does your definition of "done" for each Product Backlog Item include full automated test coverage and refactoring?</label>
                <label><input type="checkbox"> Are team members pair programming or mob programming most of the time?</label>
